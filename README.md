# Big Five Personality & Burnout Risk Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between personality traits (BIG5), job roles, and burnout risk. It processes raw psychometric data and generates color-coded visualizations and risk reports.

## ## Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to map personality scores against specific job requirements to identify "person-job fit" and predict potential burnout levels.

### ### Data Sources

* `BIG5.zip`: Contains the raw personality assessment scores for participants.
* `db_30_1_excel.zip`: The primary database containing job profiles and individual performance metrics.

## ## Methodology

### 1. Color Coding Logic

I implemented a color-coding system to quickly identify alignment:

* **Job Color:** Categorizes roles based on the dominant trait required (e.g., Green for high Agreeableness, Blue for high Conscientiousness).
* **Person Color:** Categorizes individuals based on their primary Big Five traits.
* **Scores:** Normalization of the five traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.

### 2. Burnout Risk Assessment

The `burnout_risk_report.csv` is generated by cross-referencing the **Person Color** with the **Job Color**.

> **Note:** A significant mismatch between a person's natural traits and their job requirements is used as a primary indicator for the "Burnout Risk" score.

## ## Key Outputs

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Sheet1` (Pivot Table) | Aggregated view of average scores grouped by Job Category and Person Color. |
| `burnout_risk_report.csv` | The final export listing individuals, their fit scores, and their calculated risk level. |

## ## How to Use

1. **Extract** the `.zip` files into the `/data` directory.
2. **Run** the analysis script (e.g., `main.py` or your Jupyter Notebook).
3. **View** the pivot table in Excel to see the distribution of traits.
4. **Review** `burnout_risk_report.csv` for actionable HR insights.
