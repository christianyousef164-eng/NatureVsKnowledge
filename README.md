Big Five Personality & Burnout Risk AnalysisThis project analyzes the relationship between personality traits (BIG5), job roles, and burnout risk. It processes raw psychometric data and generates color-coded visualizations and risk reports.## Project OverviewThe goal of this analysis is to map personality scores against specific job requirements to identify "person-job fit" and predict potential burnout levels.### Data SourcesBIG5.zip: Contains the raw personality assessment scores for participants.db_30_1_excel.zip: The primary database containing job profiles and individual performance metrics.## Methodology1. Color Coding LogicI implemented a color-coding system to quickly identify alignment:Job Color: Categorizes roles based on the dominant trait required (e.g., Green for high Agreeableness, Blue for high Conscientiousness).Person Color: Categorizes individuals based on their primary Big Five traits.Scores: Normalization of the five traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.2. Burnout Risk AssessmentThe burnout_risk_report.csv is generated by cross-referencing the Person Color with the Job Color.Note: A significant mismatch between a person's natural traits and their job requirements is used as a primary indicator for the "Burnout Risk" score.Shutterstock Explore ## Key OutputsFileDescriptionSheet1 (Pivot Table)Aggregated view of average scores grouped by Job Category and Person Color.burnout_risk_report.csvThe final export listing individuals, their fit scores, and their calculated risk level.## How to UseExtract the .zip files into the /data directory.Run the analysis script (e.g., main.py or your Jupyter Notebook).View the pivot table in Excel to see the distribution of traits.Review burnout_risk_report.csv for actionable HR insights.
